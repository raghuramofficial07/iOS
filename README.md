Welcome to my **iOS Development** repository! This project showcases the **apps I’ve built** as part of my learning journey in iOS development. I’ve built **multiple apps** using **Swift** and **UIKit**, all of which were implemented as I worked through various **Udemy courses** on iOS development.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- **Swift**
- **UIKit**
- **CoreData**
- **SwiftUI**
- **Xcode**

## 🎓 Learning Path
All the apps in this repository were developed while taking structured **Udemy courses** on iOS development. These courses helped me understand the fundamentals of mobile app development, from building simple interfaces to working with more advanced features like data storage and networking.

## 📚 Key Skills Learned
- **Swift Programming**: Gained expertise in writing clean, efficient Swift code and understanding the syntax.
- **UIKit & SwiftUI**: Learned how to build responsive, intuitive user interfaces using both UIKit and SwiftUI.
- **CoreData & Persistence**: Implemented local data storage and persistence to manage app data.
- **Networking & APIs**: Integrated external data sources using network requests (REST APIs, JSON parsing).
- **User Interface Design**: Focused on creating clean, visually appealing, and functional user experiences.
- **App Architecture**: Explored design patterns like MVC, MVVM, and understanding best practices for structuring iOS apps.

## 🚀 My iOS Development Journey
Each app built in this repository represents a particular concept or skill that I learned in my Udemy courses. These projects helped me understand the complexities of iOS app development and gave me the opportunity to apply what I was learning in real-time.

## 🛠️ What’s Inside This Repository
This repo contains the source code for the apps I’ve built throughout my iOS learning path:

- **Complete Source Code** for each iOS app.
- **README Documentation** with detailed explanations on features, modules, and challenges faced.
- **Screenshots** to visualize the app’s UI/UX.
- **Code Snippets** for demonstrating iOS-specific implementation techniques.

## 🌱 Future Goals
- **Advanced iOS Development**: I plan to continue learning and building more complex apps, including integrating **ARKit**, **CoreML**, and **CloudKit**.
- **App Optimization**: Focus on improving performance, testing, and debugging skills.
