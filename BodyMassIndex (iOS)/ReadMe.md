# 📱 BMI Calculator App

A simple Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator iOS application built using UIKit and the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture pattern.

## 🚀 Features

- User inputs height and weight to calculate BMI
- Displays BMI value with category interpretation (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, etc.)
- Clean and intuitive UI built using UIKit
- Navigation implemented using Segues and ViewControllers

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- 🧱 UIKit
- 📐 Swift (Structs, self.prepare(for segue:), etc.)
- 🎯 MVC Architecture
- 🚏 Storyboard-based navigation with ViewControllers and Segues

## 💡 Concepts Used

- UIKit components: UILabel, UITextField, UIButton
- Segue navigation (prepare(for segue:) and viewDidLoad)
- Data passing between ViewControllers
- Swift Structs for BMI calculation logic
- Basic MVC design: separating logic (Model) from UI (View) and interaction (Controller)
