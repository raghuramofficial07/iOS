# 🥚 iOS Egg Boil Timer App ⏱️

A clean and minimal iOS timer app developed using **Swift** and **UIKit** in **Xcode**, designed to assist with perfectly timed egg boiling. This app is built with simplicity and purpose — choose your boil type, hit start, and let the timer do its job. No distractions. No second chances.

## 🔥 Features

- 🍳 Select boil type: **Soft**, **Medium**, or **Hard**
- ⏲️ Auto-calculated timer based on selected egg type
- 🔊 Emits a **beep sound** upon timer completion
- 🛑 **No pause** or **resume** — once started, the timer **runs to completion**
- 🎯 Focused, distraction-free interface for quick usability

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language**: Swift  
- **Framework**: UIKit  
- **IDE**: Xcode  
- **Audio**: System sound triggered using `AVFoundation`

## 🚀 Why This Project?

This timer app was built as part of my iOS development learning journey. The goal was to understand user interactions, time-based functions, and integrating audio feedback. It’s a step forward in learning how real-world apps are structured with purpose and constraint-driven logic.
